            Thinking of taking a trip to Seattle? There you&#39;ll be able to see the famous fish toss at Pike&#39;s Market shown above as well as many other unique and fun attractions like the Space Needle and the ferry.

            But instead of staying at a hotel, maybe you&#39;d like to experience one of Seattle&#39;s many neighborhoods and see things that are off the beaten path. Airbnb may be just what you&#39;re looking for. Airbnb facilitates people renting their homes to travelers.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#34;OK, I&#39;ll bite&#34;, you say. &#34;But I have questions&#34;. The rest of this post will attempt to answer 3 common questions that travelers ask using data provided by Airbnb for the year 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>What&#39;s the best time of year to go in terms of rental availability?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/AirBnb available units per month for 2017.png" width=552 height=414>
        </p>
        <p>
            From the plot above you can see that availability shouldn&#39;t be an issue at any time of the year. In general, the months at the beginning of the year have the lowest number of available homes while the end of the year has the most available.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>How much can I expect to pay for a rental?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/AirBnb housing units by price for 2017.png" width=552 height=414>
        </p>
        <p>
            The plot above shows that by far the most common prices per day are $100 and $150. But there are numerous rentals for less than that if your budget is tight. If you&#39;re looking for a more upscale rental there are a good number of housing units available for $200 to $300. After $300, there are many fewer rentals at higher prices.

            <i>What factors contribute most significantly to the rating for a rental?</i>

            From the list above we can see that &#34;value&#34; was the most important factor in determining the overall score for the listing.
            Cleanliness was also important in determining the overall score.
