> The following packages must be installed in order to run the jupyter notebook
+ jupyter
+ numpy
+ pandas
+ matplotlib
+ sklearn
+ seaborn
## Project Motivation
> This project is an exercise in the Udacity Data Science curriculum designed to teach students how to write a data science blog post.

> The heart of the project is a high level analysis of Airbnb data from Seattle for the year 2017. It attempts to answer 3 questions
+ What months have the best availability for Airbnb housing?
+ What price can I expect to pay for an Airbnb unit?
+ What factors are most predictive of the overall rating given in AirBnb reviews
## File Descriptions
> The code is contained in a single file, seattle_airbnb_analusis.ipynb

> The data files were downloaded from the Kaggle web site at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle
The web site contains descriptions of the contents of each of the files
## How to Interact with your project
> To run the project open the seattle_airbnb_analusis.ipynb in jupyter or jupyter lab and run all cells

## Summary of findings
+ Availability is not an issue but more homes are available toward the end of the year
+ The majority of prices are between $50 and $200 dollars a night
+ Value and cleanliness are the most significant factors contributing to the overall score in a review
